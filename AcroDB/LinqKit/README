Sorry, that I have put this part of library to my code. This was made to minimize the count of assemblies in project.
Thank you for good lib.

What is LINQKit?

LINQKit is a free set of extensions for LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework power users. It comprises the following:

    * An extensible implementation of AsExpandable()
    * A public expression visitor base class (ExpressionVisitor)
    * PredicateBuilder
    * Linq.Expr and Linq.Func shortcut methods

With LINQKit, you can:

    * Plug expressions into EntitySets and EntityCollections
    * Use expression variables in subqueries
    * Combine expressions (have one expression call another)
    * Dynamically build predicates
    * Leverage AsExpandable to add your own extensions.

AsExpandable is based on a very clever project by Tomas Petricek. ExpressionVisitor comes from a sample by Matt Warren.

LINQKit includes full source code, and is released under a permissive free license.
